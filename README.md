# Raspberry PI 

For an interview at [isense company](http://isenseco.com/) in summer of 1401 I assigned a task 

Connect Raspberry PI to PC and send data between them.

This is done.

I find that besides ssh we can connect to Raspberry with serial port and access to login shell.

Now it is connect and show login and debug logs but I can't enter any key in login shell.
